                <h4>Educational Blunders:</h4>
                <p>
                    <span> By the grace of God and the guy sitting in front of me, somehow completed Schooling from <b>
                            St. Xavier’s High school Nasik. </b>
                        Struggled badly and after offering sweets to different Gods just before exams, managed to escape
                        from class 12th of <b> St. Joseph’s College Allahabad. </b></span>

                    <span> And Graduation from <b> Allahabad University </b> taught me the importance of all religion
                        and that all religions teach same thing. I actually realised when I was visiting temples,
                        mosques, churches and gurudwaras and asking for same thing "God", please pass me this time. Next
                        year I will sincerely study” for all the 3 years.
                        Teachers helped me pass Post Graduation in Human Resource Management from <b> Pondicherry
                            University </b> in order to save their face and reputation. </span>

                    <span> Professors got so confused on seeing my answer paper in <b> PGDPM&IR from Bharatiya Vidya
                            Bhawan’s college of Management,</b> Bhopal chapter, that to avoid controversy and direct
                        fight with me, decided to handover my certificate to ensure I don’t show them my face again.
                    </span>

                    <span> One fine day with my over enthusiasm I thought what is so great about <b> Philip Kotler.</b>
                        If he can do then I can also do. I actually realised the blunder I committed by listening to the
                        inspirational speakers when I had to copy ultimately from his book to pass my PGD in Sales and
                        Marketing Management to recover my course fees.
                        And finally <b> Ph.D in Human Resource Management </b> from <b> Pt. Sunderlal Sharma
                            University,</b> Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur made me realise that “ Neither I know anything nor
                        others know anything”. Still wondering who was that great joker who advised me to study for so
                        many years. </span>
                </p>
                <h4>Career Disasters:</h4>
                <p>
                    <span> Started seeing the glamour of so called high corporate life, 1st time at Indore. My 1st job,
                        all so rosy.. Oh my my !!!!!!
                        Learnt the new principle of Management “ Always work hard to succeed” but there was a little
                        change . It is actually ‘always work hard (on your boss) to succeed’. </span>

                    <span> After learning many things there for 2.5 years, moved to the next job at Chennai. New place,
                        New life… had the opportunity to work directly with the top management. <b> Felt like a CEO
                            myself.</b> Learned and executed many new things in HR and admin. But then in a span of 5
                        years my 3rd eye opened and learned a new principal of management “Never stand behind a horse
                        and in front of your Boss. Result is you get a kick on your shock absorber. </span>

                    <span> Realising the secret pain of HR Management and getting beaten up daily by the management and
                        workers, I thought let me try Sales. Probably the easiest thing to do and joined a Healthcare
                        MNC at Bangalore and was heading Sales of India’s leading Drug Index brand for 6 years. Wow..
                        what a life it was in the beginning… dressed up in Tie and suit, goggles, laptop, shining shoes,
                        meetings in 5 start hotels…. but …but… what was happening after 1 hour of meeting was… Oh God…
                        Oh God…. (murmuring started all across the room in the 5 start hotel) Who told this idiot to
                        give this kind of target.. Has he himself ever achieved this figure…. He is asking as if this is
                        his father’s company…. Collection ??? is the dealer my father-in-law that I will ask and he will
                        make all pending payment… Iski !!!!!! “ </span>
                    <span> Learned all the ‘M’s of Management but this experience taught me another principle of
                        management. Want success, implement ITUS principle of management. For those how are new to
                        management, ITUS mean <b> <em> “Iski Topi, Uska Sar”.</em> </b> </span>

                    <span> Got fedup with all failures in Sales, I decided to venture out new career in <b> Malawi,
                            Africa.
                            Dec 2008, </b> standing within green hills, clean road, lovely cars, clear sky… Wow , I am
                        in Africa to handle Sales and factory HR. Lovely experience with a new kind of human resources
                        around speaking in strange language. One fine day I decide to go out alone for shopping. While
                        returning with hand full of packets from the shop, walking and enjoying unpolluted breeze,
                        suddenly got stopped by 2 guys smiling at me. And within seconds I was amazed to realise that
                        atleast they were kind enough to leave me with my shirt and pant to walk back sad emoji </span>

                    <span> Within days…back to Bangalore, my own Bangalore with my sales in health communication company
                        for 2 years.
                        No new management principle learnt. Remembered my school poem by H.W.Long fellow .. “Mid
                        pleasures and palaces though we may roam, Be it ever so humble there’s no place like home”.
                    </span>

                    <span> But greed never ends. Always had this notion IT guys are the best paid in this world and so
                        decided to move to a software company. Now I am a techy guy in HR with hope of getting huge
                        salary…. But realised dreams never come true. Never go by what you hear. Before joining IT , I
                        never heard of late night client call, work-from-home (means if you are sitting on pot in the
                        morning, you still need to attend calls), P-I-P ( a sophisticated way of saying No salary hike
                        this year for you), Skip-level-meeting (means my subordinates are poisoning my boss against me
                        which he will use before appraisal), and so on…. </span>
